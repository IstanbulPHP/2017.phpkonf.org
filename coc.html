Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing / uniforms / costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. <br/><br/>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. <br/><br/>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts. <br/><br/>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel / venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. <br/><br/>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
